            Acoustra are one of the most versatile wedding bands you will ever see. 15 years in the entertainment business means we know how to read a crowd and how to interact with them. Our extensive set incorporates all the music you need for your wedding.Hearing is believing: We are in our element playing to a full room of people up for a good time. All the top country classics for jiving, sets of waltzes, 60"s and 70"s classics that everyone loves to dance to, and of course, Irish/Folk and Irish Trad

With accordion as lead instrument we get the floor hopping with a siege of Ennis, we play popular Irish and Folk Ballads, slow songs for intimate moments on the dance floor, Rock and Roll medleys, Swing and Boogie and of course up to date chart hits.
