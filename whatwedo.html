        We booked Acoustra for our wedding in May this year. They were just fantastic! They played all different types of music and were so accommodating in playing some Irish dancing music for the dancers! They sang our first dance which was brilliant and finished with a Coldplay song which everyone is still talking about. It was amazing. The dance floor was hopping all night. Thanks so much lads! Ye were brilliant !

        We would like to say a huge Thank you to The Acoustra gang, you were absolutely phenomenal.From the very beginning they got the crowd going, you really catered for everyone young and old, everyone got to boogy!! You really knew how to judge the crowd and what they liked. The floor was jam packed the whole night, you did a super performance. 
We'd like to say a special thanks for putting together the Remix for our first dance, it was such craic!
We look forward to seeing you play in Flannerys some night and we will be recommending you to our friends. Lovely guys and so nice to deal with.

        Hi lads.
Just a quick e-mail to urself and all the gang to say a massive massive thank you for doing the music for our wedding. Absolutely everybody has been singing your praises to us on how brilliant the music was and how much fun they had. I dont think the floor was empty for not one song ye did a fantastic job playing to the crowd.
A lot of my relatives had said that many weddings they go to now the band don't know what type of music to be playing because of the mixture of old and young people but ye got the balance just perfect. Thanks again for paying all the songs I requested, I honestly thought I was being a bridezilla requesting them, ha ha, but ye were so good to get them for me, and for letting everybody up to sing on the night they had a great time.
Yer version of first dance Iron and Wine was so beautiful we loved it better than the original  We have recommended ye to everybody we know so we hope ye get loads more bookings because ye really are an amazing band.

I want to say a special word of thanks for the beautiful rendition of our first dance, it was beautiful and we were so engrossed in it that we forgot where we were! We will never forget that moment
